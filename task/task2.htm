    <p>Nature is the ultimate source of our living. Both living and non-living things include nature, and everyone is interdependent, which helps maintain the ecosystem. Plants, animals, and humans all depend on nature for their survival. It supplies oxygen, sunlight, soil, water, and other necessary components.</p>

        A monsoon is a seasonal change in the direction of the prevailing,
         or strongest, winds of a region. 
           Monsoons cause wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics.
                   Monsoons are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. 
                            Monsoons always blow from cold to warm regions

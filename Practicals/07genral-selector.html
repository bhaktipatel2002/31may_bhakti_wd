    <h1>Hope is the belief in the probability of the possible rather than the necessity of the probable.</h1>
    <h1>There’s a real sweet spot between challenge and hope – leaders make pathways that keep both firmly in view.</h1>
    <h1>Young people have an almost biological destiny to be hopeful.</h1>
    <h1>Well-told stories help turn moments of great crises into moments of new beginnings.</h1>
    <p>The fact of the matter is, when resisting change becomes more “costly” than accepting change, change happens.</p>
    <h1>Challenging the status quo takes commitment, courage, imagination, and, above all, dedication to learning.</h1>
    <h1>The challenge of the heart is one of motivation, of urgent need to act, and of hope for success, and the courage to risk it.</h1>
    <h1>“Emphasizing that forgiving allows us to access the wisdom we can gain from an experience.”</h1>

    <h1>“If we hold onto our wounds in an area of life then we hold back the growth of wisdom in that area too.”</h1>

    <h1>“A more forgiving attitude makes it easier to develop wisdom…Likewise a deeper capacity for wisdom makes it easier to forgive.”</h1>
